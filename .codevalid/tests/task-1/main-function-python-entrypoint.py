The test file [.codevalid/tests/task-1/main-function-python-entrypoint.py](.codevalid/tests/task-1/main-function-python-entrypoint.py) has been updated to include exactly the seven required pytest test cases, matching your specifications. Each test uses proper mocking for `setup_logging`, `UserService`, `display_users`, and `logging`, and asserts the correct behavior for all scenarios: successful fetch, empty list, fetch exception, logging setup failure, display exception, large user list, and UserService instantiation failure. Test names, structure, and assertions strictly follow your requirements.
